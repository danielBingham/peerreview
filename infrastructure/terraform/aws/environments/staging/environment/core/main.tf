/******************************************************************************
 * Staging Environment Core
 *
 * This modudle defines the core of the Peer Review staging environment.
 *
 * Depends on:
 * - Storage
 * - Certificate
 *
 * If you would like to add monitoring in to this environment, see Monitoring.
 * To launch bastions for VPC access, see Bastion.  DNS must be handled
 * manually due to being generated by Kubernetes.
 *
 * Before launching this environment, please read the README.md file and ensure
 * that all components that this module will create have not been created as
 * individual components in the `/components` directory.  Go through each
 * component in the directory and run `terraform destroy` to ensure that the
 * component has been destroyed.  Or use `terraform state mv` to move
 * components to this state file.
 *
