# Copy only the files and directories we need, one per command, from least
# likely to change to most likely to change.  This maximizes layer caching in
# our rebuilds and minimizes build times.  It also saves space - we don't need
# the tests in the image.  We probably shouldn't be building the production
# image if we haven't already run the tests.
#
# TODO In the future, allow for the construction of development images that
# include the tests, among other things, and can load code on a volume to allow
# development to happen in a docker image.
