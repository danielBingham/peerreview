# Peer Review - Development Documentation

This directory contains code, infrastructure, and development documentation for Peer Review.  If you're looking to contribute, this is probably where you should start.  Fair warning, it's pretty sparse right now.  As we're able to put in more time, and as additional contributors join, we'll work on fleshing it out and getting it really solid.  Right now it's absolute barebones.

Legend:

- **TODO**: Not written yet, but intended.
- **WIP**: Partially in progress.
