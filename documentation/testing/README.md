# Testing Peer Review

To run a test, create a new directory in `/documentation/testing/runs` named
`YYYY-MM-DD`.  Copy the appropriate plans into that directory.  When a plan is
re-run multiple times with different parameters, append an integer index to the
end of the plan name, eg. `journals/creation.md` becomes
`journals/creation-1.md` and update the link at the appropriate point in the
parent plan.

Plans can be found in `/documentation/testing/plans`.
