# Roadmap Brainstorm

This document is for proposed features that haven't yet made it on to the
formal roadmap, and that we're not sure if they should make it on to the formal
roadmap or not.  These features are very much up for discussion.

## Proposed

**Voting on Responses** 
Users can vote on responses granting/removing reputation to/from the writer of
the response.  Users can also order responses by score.  The amount of
reputation would be significantly smaller than either paper votes or reviews.

Hesitation is whether this makes sense, whether writing public responses is
something we actually want to incentivize that heavily.

**Linking Replications**
Users can mark published papers as replications of already published papers,
and have them appear on a "Replications" tab on that paper's page (as well as
all the normal places they would appear).  We'd also offer a reputation bonus
for posted replications (to be determined).

**Field Graph**
A navigable graph view of the fields (maybe 3d?).
