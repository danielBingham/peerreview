# Authentication 

As a user, I want to be able to create an account and login because it will
allow me to have ownership of my papers, comments, and votes.

As a developer, I want to use an authentication and authorization system to
ensure users may only perform the actions they are allowed to.

## Background and Description
*On a high level, what do we want to achieve? Why are we doing it and what
related things have we done before?*

We need to create the authentication and authorization system so that we can
allow users to create accounts and login.  This will allow them to post paper
drafts, to give reviews, to accept reviews and publish their papers, to post
paper responses, and to vote on papers. It will allow us to ensure users can
only perform the actions they are allowed to.

This is generally one of the first things we need to create when starting a new
web app.

## Acceptance Criteria
*How will we know when the milestone has been achieved?  These should be
verifiable, testable statements.*

- Users can register themselves with a name, email, and password.
    - Users are asked to confirm their password and rejected if the passwords don't match.
    - Emails are validated and rejected if they are not valid emails.
    - Attempts to register are rejected if a user with that email already exists.
    - Passwords are validated and rejected if they aren't strong enough (based solely on length).
    - Users are sent an email with a link to a token endpoint to confirm their email.
- Registered users can login using their email and password.
    - Registered users can request a password reset, and are sent a link with a token to allow them to reset.
- Users can view their profile.
    - Users viewing their own profile are shown an edit button.
- Users can edit their profile.
    - Users can change their name.
    - Users must confirm their password to change their email or password.
    - Users changing their email must verify their email ownership by being sent a token.
- Users are presented with links to login and register in the main navigation when not logged in.
- Users are presented with links to view their profile and logout in the main navigation when logged in.
- Users who are logged in may log out.

## What do we need to do?
*Here's where you can brainstorm and document what we need to do to achieve
this milestone and how we can go about doing it.*

### Users API
First, we'll need to define the **Users API**.

We'll start by defining the `user` object:

```js
{
    id: integer, // The unique identifier of the user.
    name: string, // The user's name.
    email: string, // The user's email, used as a login credential.
    password: string // The user's password, used as a login credential.  Never sent to the frontend.
}
```

> **NOTE**: We'll use "fully populated" to refer to a `user` object that has all of the
> above fields populated.  We'll use "populated" to refer to a `user` object that
> has the appropriate set of fields for the context (for example, if
> being returned from the backend, the `password` will be missing or if being
> POSTed from the frontend, the `id` field will be missing).  We'll use
> "partially populated" to refer to a `user` object missing one or more fields. 

Then we need to define the end points.  We'll use the verbs `GET`, `POST`,
`PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` with both the singular and plural endpoints.
Unless otherwise noted, the request body and return will be `json`.

#### `/users` Endpoint

> **NOTE**: The user's password hash should **never** be returned from any of
> this endpoints.  It should be stripped out from all `users` returned in
> responses.

`GET /users`: 

Retrieve all users.

**Request**: No body.

**Response**: All users in the database as an array containing populated `user`
objects, or an empty array if there are no users.

**Errors**:

- Returns `500` and `unknown-error` on server error.

**Authorization**: Anyone.

`POST /users`:

Create one or more users.

**Request**: One or more populated `user` objects in an array. The `id`
field **may not** be populated, and will be ignored if provided.

**Action**: Adds the posted users to the database as new users.  They will be
assigned autogenerated id numbers.

**Errors**: 

- `user.email` must be unique.  Returns `400` and `'email-exists'` error.
- `user.email`, `user.name`, and `user.password` must all be populated.  Returns `400` and `incomplete-user` error.
- `user.email` must be a valid email.  Returns `400` and `invalid-email` error.
- `user.password` must be at least 16 characters. Returns `400` and `inadequate-password` error.
- `user.id` is populated -- no error, just delete it.
- Returns `500` and `unknown-error` on server error.

**Response**: The newly added user(s) with `id` populated, as an array
containing `user` objects.

**Authorization**: If no user is logged in, then the request is limited to a
single user.  Admin users may submit multiple users.

`PUT /users`:

Create or overwrite one or more users.

**Request**: One or more populated `user` objects in an array.  The
`id` field **may** be populated.

**Action**: Adds the users in the request body to the database.  If the `id`
field is populated, will replace users on that id.  Otherwise, creates new
users. 

**Errors**: 

- `user.email` must be unique (may match the user identified by `id` if provided).  Returns `400` and `'email-exists'` error.

single user, and it must be themselves.  Admin users may submit an arbitrary
numbers of users.

`DELETE /users`: 

Delete one or more users.

**Response**: Empty response. 

**Authorization**: User must be logged in.

### Users Redux Slice

Create a redux slice for the **Users API** with thunks for each of the
endpoints. The initial state of the slice should contain a dictionary for users
retrieved from the backend and a dictionary for requests we have made or are
making to the backend.

```javascript
{
    requests: {},
    users: {}
}
```

Create generic `makeRequest`, `failRequest`, `completeRequest`, and
`cleanupRequest` methods.  These methods will work primarily with the
`requests` hash to track requests in progress.  We want to be able to track
more than one request in process, because its plausible that we would kick off
several requests before the first one returns and we want to make sure we're
not in a situation where we're losing track of requests.

`completeRequest` will assume we're getting one or more populated `user`
object(s) and adding them to the hash.  If we need to do something different at
the end of a request, such as delete a user from the dictionary, then we'll
need a specific complete method of the form
`complete[Method][EndpointBase]Request`.  For example,
`completeDeleteUserRequest`.

In this case, we only need a `completeDeleteUserRequest`, all other methods
should return either an array of `user` objects or a single `user` object.
